# About

Tool for automatic executables porting to Linux and Windows.

The relinker-only build runs on macOS, including Apple silicon.

[**Web converter**](https://boykopovar.github.io/AnyPS5/) - files stay on your device.

![anyps5_collage1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed2f0b2d-33d3-46d7-ab88-767ca872fc99)

Includes a [relinker](core/relinker) that converts executable to the target system's native format and implementations of [system prx libraries](core/libs/prx) suitable for dynamic linking. No emulation or separate runtime process.

[Progress history](https://boykopovar.github.io/AnyPS5/history.html)

<sub>* System libraries: percentage of the functions known to the project so far (declared in [core/libs/prx](core/libs/prx)), not of every PS5 system function. The total grows as more functions are declared.</sub>

Unsupported or unexpected states strictly throw `std::runtime_error`. `what()` is printed to stderr and the process terminates.

The [shader recompiler](core/shader/recompiler/Recompiler.cpp) successfully produces SPIR-V (validated via [Spirv-Tools](3rdparty/SPIRV-Tools) when built with `ANYPS5_ENABLE_SPIRV_TOOLS`).

## Compatibility

Per-game status and test reports live in the [Game bring-up](https://github.com/boykopovar/AnyPS5/discussions/categories/game-bring-up) discussions, one thread per title.

## Input mapping

SDL-mapped game controllers are supported, including analog sticks and triggers. Keyboard and mouse controls can be configured with an `anyps5-input.ini` file. See [input mapping](docs/user/INPUT_MAPPING.md) for the supported devices and configuration format.
